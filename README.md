# COVID Misinformation in Nigeria

This code base contains the code used to download tweets from users based in Nigeria from January 1st, 2020 to October 31st, 2020. We have some python scripts and notebooks for how we cleaned the data and some analysis on the tweets. We do not include the actual twitter data that we used for privacy reasons. The project is also still ongoing. You can view our slide deck to get more information on the data we use and future plans.
